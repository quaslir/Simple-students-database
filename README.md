📚 Student Database (C Project)

This small project creates a simple student database with three fields:
name, age, and grade.

🚀 How to Run

After cloning the repository, compile and run the program:

gcc students.c -o students
./students


When the program starts, you will see three choices:

Create a new database

Load an existing database

Exit

If you just cloned the repository, choose Create a new database and enter some students.

🔧 Features
🔹 Sorting

You can sort the database by:

Age

Grade

Name (alphabetically)

And choose:

Ascending order

Descending order

You can also skip sorting if you prefer to keep the original order.

🔹 Saving

After working with the database, the program will ask if you want to save it.
⚠️ If you choose not to save, all data will be lost.

🔹 Loading

After saving your database, you can load it again later and continue working with it.

🔹 Additional Functions

Once a database is loaded, you can:

Delete a student

Sort the database again

Edit the database manually using the Nano console editor

Find a group of students by specific parameters (e.g., same age or same grade)

A simple but practical demonstration of working with files, structs, and basic database logic in C.
